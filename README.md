## Project Introduction

[apisix](https://github.com/apache/apisix) is a cloud-native API gateway with features such as dynamic, real-time, and high performance. This product provides an out-of-the-box apisix based on the Huawei Cloud EulerOS 2.0 64-bit system of Kunpeng servers.

## Core Features

- **High Performance**: Adopts the RadixTree routing matching algorithm, with a single-core QPS of over 23,000 and extremely low latency.
- **Multi-platform Support**: Compatible with bare metal, Kubernetes, and cloud function environments (such as AWS Lambda and Azure Function).
- **Security Protection**: Built-in multiple authentication methods (such as JWT, search for [IP blacklist/whitelist]), and supports custom plugin development.
